# A-Modelica-Based-Generalized-Average-Model-Library-for-PWM-Inverters
This is a model library developed using the Modelica modeling language for generalized averaging modeling of PWM inverters.

## Abstract
* `GNU_ScientificLibrary` is an open-source library from the Modelica community for computing various mathematical functions;

* `Power_GAM` is a model library developed by the author for generalized average modeling of PWM inverters.

* Folder `case1`  contains simulation result data for Case Model 1 of `Power_GAM` .

* Folder `case2` contains simulation result data for Case Model 2 of `Power_GAM` .

* Folder `CPU_time` contains CPU simulation time consumption under different simulation models for Case Models 1 and 2;

  This model library has been incorporated as one of the research outcomes in the **MDPI Electronic** journal article titled “Research on Generalized Average Modeling and Characteristic Harmonic Frequency Configuration Strategy for PWM Inverter using Modelica,” which is currently under review.
